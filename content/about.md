Hi, I'm **Evert Timberg**. I'm a software engineer living in Toronto, Canada.

I am currently working for National Instruments as a Staff Software Engineer. I started at NI soon after graduating from the University of Toronto in 2013 with a BASc in Electrical Engineering. 

Initially I worked on [Multisim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NI_Multisim) which is primarily written in C++. I had a chance to work in some fairly old legacy code, including the Berkeley [SPICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE) engine. 

Since December of 2014, I have been a maintainer of [Chart.js](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js). In that time I have written a lot of the improvements for the version 2 release including multiple axis support and the ability to create new scale types with relative ease.

To contact me, email me at evert [dot] timberg [at] gmail.com or send me an invitation to connect on one of my social networks.

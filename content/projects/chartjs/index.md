Since late 2014, I have been involved with [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org). I am currently, along with Tanner Linsley, one of the primary contributors and was responsible for a number of the big developments in version 2.

It's been a great adventure, and my first experience with open-source development. It's scary at times to think that my code gets 50k+ downloads a month. Chart.js was also my first experience using the HTML 5 Canvas APIs, but it felt quite natural coming from C++ code that made use of Windows [GDI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145203(v=vs.85).aspx) APIs. A lot of the tricks used to improve canvas performance are similar to the tricks done in legacy GDI code. 

In addition to feature work, I added most of the initial tests to the project. I added the infrastructure to get tests and coverage analysis running. I enjoy adding and improving tests when writing features.

[vaccine-ontario.ca](https://vaccine-ontario.ca) was a website built during the spring of 2021 to help Ontarians find and book a Covid-19 vaccine. The site was built my a multi-disciplinary team of volunteers who came together to help our neighbours.

The site was built with React, Typescript, and Firestore. The initial UI was built with material-ui which was progressively replaced with hand-written components for performance reasons. My contribution was primarily related to the UI where I tackled key features such as:
* Responsive layout to support mobile and tablets
* Performance improvements (> 10x improvement on key use cases)
* Sorting and filtering or clinics and data

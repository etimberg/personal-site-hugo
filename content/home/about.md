Hi, I'm **Evert Timberg**. I'm a software developer living in Toronto, Canada.

<br>
I am currently a Principal Architect at [Opus One Solutions](https://www.opusonesolutions.com/) where I get to combine my love of electrical engineering and software to help electrical utilities integrate renewable resources into the grid. At Opus One, I work primarily in Python and JavaScript to develop grid planning, simulation, and optimization software. 

<br>
Prior to Opus One, I worked for National Instruments as a Staff Software Developer. I started at NI soon after graduating from the University of Toronto in 2013 with a BASc in Electrical Engineering. At National Instruments, I worked on [Multisim and Ultiboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NI_Multisim) which are schematic capture, simulation, and layout tools for electronics design.

<br>
Since December of 2014, I have been a maintainer of [Chart.js](http://chartjs.org). In that time I've been responsible for creating and architecting the version 2 update. That work has translated into a very successful series of [releases](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases) and have led many people to pick Chart.js for their sites.

Hi, I'm **Evert Timberg**. I'm a software developer living in Toronto, Canada.

I am currently a Principal Developer at [Top Hat](https://tophat.com) where I'm working to improve the lives of post-secondary students by changing how digital textbooks and courseware are delivered. At Top Hat, I support a number of development teams by guiding them  to build sustainable services using Python, React, and Cloud Native technologies.

Prior to Top hat, I was a Principal Architect at [Opus One Solutions](https://www.opusonesolutions.com/) where I developed software to help electrical utilities integrate renewable resources into the grid. Prior to that, I worked for National Instruments as a Software Developer. I started at NI soon after graduating from the University of Toronto in 2013 with a BASc in Electrical Engineering.

Since December of 2014, I have been a maintainer of [Chart.js](http://chartjs.org). In that time I've been responsible for creating and architecting the version 2 and 3 updates. That work has translated into a very successful series of [releases](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases) and have led many people to pick Chart.js for their applications. If you've found value in my work, I'd appreciate support via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/etimberg).

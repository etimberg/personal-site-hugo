Welcome to my personal site. I wrote the site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go. It's been a great introduction to the Go template language. Hosting is done via static files published to Github pages. The theme for this site is based on a modified version of the [Introduction](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-introduction) theme.
